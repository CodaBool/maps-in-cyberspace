# Version 2.0.0

> it's best to use [maps.codabool.com](https://maps.codabool.com) to view the individual resources in this module.

## üì∞ Summary

### ‚úèÔ∏è Modified
16 of the tiles have been edited. In most cases this was removing text from the floor. The text most of the time gets in the way and isn't usually necessary.

### üé≠ New Scenes 
There is a huge addition of new scenes. In total 40 have been added. Since this module is still relatively new I'll keep from listing out the complete list of new scenes. But if your really curious you could see what the names are from a [diff file found in the version control](https://github.com/CodaBool/maps.codabool.com/commit/1c9b89611a893db558fac4be1a5f639c668da226).

### üöó Props
This update now has the addition of props. In total I've added 59 images. This is going to be smaller non-scene tile images. For the most part this will refer to vehicles. This is very much needed since in version 1 I included several maps that were hangars but no inclusion of vehicle which could be placed in that scene. Now you can open up a any hangar and place the ship of your choice down as a tile.
