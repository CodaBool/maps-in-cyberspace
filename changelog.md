# Version 2.13.0
I've just double checked with the scenes that they are still working in V13. They all seem to be running fine.

So, I feel comfortable adding the sweet, sweet, green verified button for V13.

## New Doors Macro

I added a macro and a startup message which prompts to use the new macro.

The new macro is found in the compendium tab and adds a way to edit all doors on the scene.

The optional macro has you pick a door animation and sound. Then performs that update for you to all doors.

## Minor Fix
I was noticing some texture error messages which pointed to a texture that did not exist. About 1/3 of the scenes had this issue, I have updated those scenes. It's not a breaking issue but if you don't like errors in the console log, reimport the scene and it should be resolved.


## Upcoming
Thank you to everyone who has donated to the project. I'm glad so many people have gotten value out of this project.

Please follow me on [Itch.io](https://codabool.itch.io/) because I have a new project coming out this Halloween 2025!

Thank you again.
